Imperial Reorganisation mod
===========================

The purpose of this mod is to allow more dynamic transferral of de-jure titles.

The idea, and the balancing mechanism, is based on the De-Jure Adjudication mod,
but with the custom title creation removed,
and made safe to use by vassals or in multiplayer.

The AI has not been made aware of how to transfer de-jure titles,
since it's difficult to even think of when it should be allowed
let alone the code to make the AI do so,
but I've found it strangely satisfying to straighten the borders.

If installing directly from version control,
copy imperial-reorganisation.mod into the CK2 mod folder
alongside the mod itself.
